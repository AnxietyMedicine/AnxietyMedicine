<h2>Hey, I'm Matt 👋🏼</h2>
<p>I'm currently a second-year full-time student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I hope to one day become a software developer (or something similar, maybe). One thing about me: I am always interested in learning something new whether it be with programming or real-world stuff. No matter how much you know, there is always something else to learn.</p>
